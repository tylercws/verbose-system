# Liquid Morphism and Glassmorphism Design Research Plan

## Task Overview
Research liquid morphism and glassmorphism design principles for modern web interfaces, covering 10 specific focus areas with comprehensive findings to be saved in `docs/liquid_morphism_design_research.md`.

## Research Areas & Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundational Design Principles
- [x] 1.1 Research core principles of liquid morphism design language
- [x] 1.2 Investigate glassmorphism visual effects and implementation techniques
- [x] 1.3 Analyze CSS techniques for creating glass-like transparency effects

### Phase 2: Creative Interface Design Patterns
- [x] 2.1 Study modern UI/UX patterns for creative tool interfaces
- [x] 2.2 Research color schemes and typography for retro/creative applications
- [x] 2.3 Examine layout patterns for image processing applications

### Phase 3: Component Architecture & Responsive Design
- [x] 3.1 Investigate component design patterns for complex interfaces
- [x] 3.2 Study responsive design considerations for creative tools
- [x] 3.3 Research accessibility considerations for glassmorphism

### Phase 4: Performance & Case Studies
- [x] 4.1 Research performance optimization for complex visual effects
- [x] 4.2 Find and analyze specific examples and case studies of successful liquid morphism implementations
- [x] 4.3 Document real-world implementation examples

### Phase 5: Synthesis & Documentation
- [x] 5.1 Compile comprehensive findings into structured report
- [x] 5.2 Include code examples and technical implementation details
- [x] 5.3 Final review and quality check

## Research Strategy
1. Use web search to identify authoritative sources and examples
2. Extract content from original design blogs, documentation, and case studies
3. Focus on recent implementations (2022-2025) for current best practices
4. Document all sources using sources_add tool
5. Ensure coverage of both theoretical principles and practical implementation

## Success Criteria
- Comprehensive coverage of all 10 focus areas
- Minimum 15 high-quality sources from design authorities
- Real-world examples and case studies
- Technical implementation details and code examples
- Actionable insights for modern web development
