# Dithering Algorithms Research Plan

## Task Overview
Research comprehensive list of dithering algorithms for image processing with focus on technical implementation, visual characteristics, and web compatibility.

## Research Categories & Progress

### 1. Core Dithering Algorithms
- [x] Floyd-Steinberg dithering algorithm and its variants
- [x] Ordered dithering (Bayer matrices) with different matrix sizes
- [x] Error diffusion algorithms (Atkinson, Stucki, Burkes, Sierra, etc.)
- [x] Random dithering and noise-based methods

### 2. Specialized Dithering Techniques
- [x] Ordered dithering algorithms for color images
- [x] Glitch art and artistic dithering effects
- [x] Halftone patterns and screening algorithms
- [x] Advanced dithering techniques for video processing

### 3. Application-Specific Research
- [x] Performance considerations for web-based implementation
- [x] Color dithering algorithms for retro/pixel art aesthetics

### 4. Documentation Requirements
For each algorithm, document:
- [x] Technical implementation details
- [x] Visual characteristics and style
- [x] Processing requirements
- [x] Web-compatible approach
- [x] Categorization (bitmap style, glitch effects, modulation, etc.)

### 5. Final Deliverable
- [x] Compile comprehensive report in `docs/dithering_algorithms_research.md`

## Research Strategy
1. Search for academic papers and technical documentation on dithering algorithms
2. Extract content from authoritative sources
3. Gather implementation details and visual characteristics
4. Focus on web-compatible implementations
5. Organize findings by algorithm type and characteristics
